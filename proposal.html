    This is a jewelry brand that focuses on creating travel-inspired designs and collections. Each piece is made to be a collectible and destination-specific with tags and charms. Ranging from bracelets to necklaces and rings the brand covers all thing’s travel and chic, creating collections/ pieces that do not look tacky. 
    However, the brand only launched in 2014 by owner Nicole Parker King, who has traveled the world and came up with this concept and brand upon never being able to find the perfect souvenir. 
    Although the jewelry is classy yet playful the companies’ logo and website are lacking in comparison.  The logo is very basic, which can be good but in this instance, it looks outdated and includes with colors that almost look childish. 
    For a company who promotes fine jewelry as souvenirs and is on the costlier side for a collection the brand does not consistently reflect these ideals.

    The target audience is aimed at a very specific viewer; those who love to travel or know those who love to. This product is a great gift piece and once a collection is started then it can be built upon. It also features generic travel-inspired designs that are great for beach lovers or just worldly in the sense. It is focused toward a higher age range, between high school-adults because the pieces are not cheap and nor is travel.  Focusing on a clientele who will appreciate quality and quantity is the objective here but this message is not relayed in their site design well. They enjoy adventure, and might work in fields like a travel agent, and fashion design. They want more of their destinations shown in a unique, fashionable way. Their favorite products might include Tiffany&co and beis. They learn about these products through channels including social media posts, word of mouth, major magazines/trends and gifts.
